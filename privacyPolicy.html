    <h3 class="privacy-heading">Use of Cookies</h3>

    <p class="privacy-content">The Launchpad Devs website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience.
        A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be
        used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you,
        and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>

    <p class="privacy-content">One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The
        purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For
        example, if you personalize Launchpad Devs pages, or register with Launchpad Devs site or
        services, a cookie helps Launchpad Devs to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.
        This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses,
        shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Launchpad Devs website, the
        information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Launchpad Devs
        features that you customized.</p>

    <p class="privacy-content">You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept
        cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you
        choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the
